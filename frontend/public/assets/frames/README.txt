Place your image sequence here.
Naming convention: frame_0000.jpg, frame_0001.jpg, ... frame_0299.jpg.
The ScrollFrameSequence component will look for these files.
Currently, it expects 300 frames. You can adjust the frameCount in src/pages/ProductLanding.jsx.
If no images are found, the site will fallback to a generative "3D" canvas animation.
